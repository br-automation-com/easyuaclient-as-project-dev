		<h1>Client program examples with OPC UA function blocks</h1>
		<p>This section explains the communication between 2 PLC systems (client-server) using several program examples.</p>
		<p class="tips">The following examples has been developed using 2 ARsim as client-server but it should be compatible with 3rd party server.</p>
		<p>Communication is established and process values communicated, e.g. querying the current values of individual variables on the OPC UA server from the OPC UA client or calling methods.<br/></p>
		<p>To keep the program examples as simple as possible, only the basic functions will be explained. In practice, for example, error handling is much more extensive.</p>
		<p>Structured Text is the only programming language used in the program examples.</p>
		<h2>Version used</h2>
		<p>Creating the program examples requires <strong>Automation Studio 4.4.1 or later</strong> and <strong>Automation Runtime C4.41 or later</strong>.</p>
